        "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax, readability, and versatility. Developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used in a wide range of applications from web development to scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key features of Python include:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ease of Learning and Use:** Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and similar to the English language, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners in programming. Its readability also allows for easier maintenance and updates to code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpreted Language:** Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier but may result in slower execution compared to compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strongly Typed:** Python is considered a strongly typed language because it does not allow operations on types that are incompatible. In a strongly typed language, the type of a value is rigidly maintained, meaning you cannot, for example, add a string to an integer without explicitly converting the string to an integer or vice versa. This characteristic ensures that type errors are caught, which can help prevent bugs in software development.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dynamic Typing:** Variables in Python are not explicitly typed. The type is associated at runtime, which adds flexibility but requires careful testing to avoid type-related errors in complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extensive Standard Library:** Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules and functions for various tasks, such as file operations, system calls, and even Internet protocols like HTTP and FTP.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Open Source and Community:** Being open-source, Python is freely available for use and distribution, including for commercial purposes. It has a large and active community that contributes to its development and offers a vast ecosystem of third-party packages and frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Multi-Paradigm:** Python supports different programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and to some extent, functional programming, making it flexible in approach depending on the problem at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Extensibility:** Python can be extended with modules written in C or C++ for critical operations that need high performance. This allows for the optimization of parts of the application without sacrificing the ease of use of the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Portability:** Python code can run on multiple platforms without modification, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix, thanks to its interpreted nature.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Wide Range of Applications:** Python is used in web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask), data science and machine learning (using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn), automation, scripting, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and the importance of programmer effort over computational effort, which is reflected in its comprehensive standard library and its principle of \"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.\" This philosophy has led to Python being adopted by beginners and experts alike and has enabled its use in many cutting-edge software projects.\n",

Colab is basically Jupyter notebook on steroids: it’s free, requires no setup, comes preinstalled with many packages, is easy to share with the world, and benefits from free access to hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs (with some caveats).\n",

        "A list in Python is a built-in data structure that can hold a collection of items. These items can be of different data types including integers, strings, tuples, other lists, and more. Lists are ordered, meaning that the items have a defined order that will not change, and they are mutable, which means that you can change their content without changing their identity. Here are some key points about lists in Python:\n",

        "Ordered: The items in a list appear in a specific order. You can use the order to access items using an index.\n",

        "Versatile: Lists can contain items of different types, including other lists, which means they can be nested.\n",
        "\n",
        "Indexable: Each item in a list is associated with an index, which you can use to access that item.\n",

When Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An unhandled exception will cause the program to terminate abruptly. Python provides a way to handle the exception gracefully using try-except blocks, allowing the programmer to respond to different error conditions or clean up resources before the program exits.\n",
